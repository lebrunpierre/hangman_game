This is for my random thoughts on creating this game.

first need to get word from word bank

identify how many chances in hangeman (7)


need to have blanks for the user word


if user gueses the letter then all the letters in that word are reviealed

if user does not guess correctly the hangman will draw


if they get all the letters they win

once full hangman is drown it is over




class user

user:
    how many lives
    what guesses they have made

    functions:
    validates the guesses
    subtract lives


class hangmangame

    hangman word
    blanks
    is_user_winner

    functions:
    turn blanks into letters
    checks if user guessed all of the letters
